                Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company
                headquartered in Cupertino, California, that designs, develops,
                and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online
                services. It is considered one of the Big Four tech companies
                along with Amazon, Google, and Facebook.[6][7] The company's
                hardware products include the iPhone smartphone, the iPad tablet
                computer, the Mac personal computer, the iPod portable media
                player, the Apple Watch smartwatch, the Apple TV digital media
                player, the AirPods wireless earbuds and the HomePod smart
                speaker. Apple's software includes the macOS, iOS, iPadOS,
                watchOS, and tvOS operating systems, the iTunes media player,
                the Safari web browser, the Shazam acoustic fingerprint utility,
                and the iLife and iWork creativity and productivity suites, as
                well as professional applications like Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro,
                and Xcode. Its online services include the iTunes Store, the iOS
                App Store, Mac App Store, Apple Music, Apple TV+, iMessage, and
                iCloud. Other services include Apple Store, Genius Bar,
                AppleCare, Apple Pay, Apple Pay Cash, and Apple Card. Apple was
                founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in April
                1976 to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer,
                though Wayne sold his share back within 12 days. It was
                incorporated as Apple Computer, Inc., in January 1977, and sales
                of its computers, including the Apple II, grew quickly. Within a
                few years, Jobs and Wozniak had hired a staff of computer
                designers and had a production line. Apple went public in 1980
                to instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple
                shipped new computers featuring innovative graphical user
                interfaces, such as the original Macintosh in 1984, and Apple's
                marketing advertisements for its products received widespread
                critical acclaim. However, the high price of its products and
                limited application library caused problems, as did power
                struggles between executives. In 1985, Wozniak departed Apple
                amicably and remained an honorary employee,[8] while Jobs and
                others resigned to found NeXT.[9] As the market for personal
                computers expanded and evolved through the 1990s, Apple lost
                market share to the lower-priced duopoly of Microsoft Windows on
                Intel PC clones. The board recruited CEO Gil Amelio to what
                would be a 500-day charge for him to rehabilitate the
                financially troubled companyâ€”reshaping it with layoffs,
                executive restructuring, and product focus. In 1997, he led
                Apple to buy NeXT, solving the desperately failed operating
                system strategy and bringing Jobs back. Jobs pensively regained
                leadership status, becoming CEO in 2000. Apple swiftly returned
                to profitability under the revitalizing Think different
                campaign, as he rebuilt Apple's status by launching the iMac in
                1998, opening the retail chain of Apple Stores in 2001, and
                acquiring numerous companies to broaden the software portfolio.
                In January 2007, Jobs renamed the company Apple Inc., reflecting
                its shifted focus toward consumer electronics, and launched the
                iPhone to great critical acclaim and financial success. In
                August 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO due to health complications,
                and Tim Cook became the new CEO. Two months later, Jobs died,
                marking the end of an era for the company. In June 2019, Jony
                Ive, Apple's CDO, left the company to start his own firm, but
                stated he would work with Apple as its primary client. Apple is
                well known for its size and revenues. Its worldwide annual
                revenue totaled $265 billion for the 2018 fiscal year. Apple is
                the world's largest technology company by revenue and one of the
                world's most valuable companies. It is also the world's
                third-largest mobile phone manufacturer after Samsung and
                Huawei.[10] In August 2018, Apple became the first public U.S.
                company to be valued at over $1 trillion.[11][12] The company
                employs 123,000 full-time employees[13] and maintains 504 retail
                stores in 24 countries as of 2018.[14] It operates the iTunes
                Store, which is the world's largest music retailer. As of
                January 2018, more than 1.3 billion Apple products are actively
                in use worldwide.[15] The company also has a high level of brand
                loyalty and is ranked as the world's most valuable brand.
                However, Apple receives significant criticism regarding the
                labor practices of its contractors, its environmental practices
                and unethical business practices, including anti-competitive
                behavior, as well as the origins of source materials.
